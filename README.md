## Just a test
Just that, tests and trash. Do not try to find anything important, just maybe useful tips.

## Interesting directories:
### VASP
This is a first and badly try to make SSCHA-VASP integration with Machine Learning. Will be best to use ASE (when is ready).
### SSCHA_documentation
A small part of the documentation for the 2023 summer school in SSCHA. Just tutorials 1 and 3.
