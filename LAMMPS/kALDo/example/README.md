# `amorphous_silicon_Tersoff_LAMMPS`

Example amorphous_silicon_Tersoff_LAMMPS illustrates how to perform thermal 
transport simulation for an amorphous silicon sample (512 atoms system) with
[LAMMPS USER-PHONON ](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Packages_details.html#pkg-user-phonon) package as force calculator.

External files required: 
		       1). forcefields/Si.tersoff 
		       2). fc_aSi512/replicated_atoms.xyz: amorphous silicon structures (same structure as aSi_512.lmp).


- The force constants calculation proceeds as follows:
			
	in.aSi512:
    1.  Compute 2nd and 3rd force constants with LAMMPS USER-PHONON
			
	or
			
	get_precalculated_fc.sh:
	1.  Download precalculated force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON

- 1_aSi512_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py proceeds as follows:

    1. Set up force constant object by loading in 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON.
			
	2. Set up phonon object and perform quantum simulation at 300K.
			
	3. Set up Conductivity object and compute thermal conductivity with Quasi Harmonic Green Kubo method.
			
	4. Set up Conductivity object and compute diffusivity with QHGK method.

- 2_aSi512_Tersoff_visualize_QHGK_properties.py proceeds as follows:

	1. Set up force constant object by loading in 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON.
			
	2. Set up phonon object and perform quantum simulation at 300K.
			
	3. Set up Conductivity object and compute thermal conductivity and diffusivity with QHGK method.
			
	4. Visualize diffusivity and cumulative conductivity from QHGK method as functions of frequency. 


- LAMMPS with speed up force constant calculations for large systems is available in the following repo: [OptimizedDynamicalMatrix](https://github.com/charlessievers/lammps/tree/fed47b9ffc833bebffe0e460739ebd6ff69e9c8d).
- Some features on the OptimizedDynamicalMatrix are broken as of commits in April 2020, please checkout the following commit which works reliably from 01/29/2020: 
	- in your cloned repo: `git checkout fed47b9ffc833bebffe0e460739ebd6ff69e9c8d`
- LAMMPS packages to install/compile include: [MAKE, MANYBODY, MOLECULE, KSPACE, USER-PHONON](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Packages_details.html).


- To compute 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> order force constants with LAMMPS USER-PHONON, navigate to this directory and execute:
```bash
./mpirun -np 8 /path/to/lammps/src/lmp_mpi < in.aSi512 > aSi512.log 
```
- To comput 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> order force constants with speed-up LAMMPS USER-PHONON, navigate to this directory and execute:
```bash
./mpirun -np 8 /path/to/lammps/src/lmp_mpi < in.aSi512_speed_up > aSi512_speed_up.log 
```
- To obtain precalcluated 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> order force constants, navigate to this directory and execute:
```bash
chmod +x  get_precalculated_fc.sh
./get_precalculated_fc.sh
```
- To perform thermal transport simulation after computing force constants, navigate to this directory and execute:
```python
python 1_aSi512_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py
python 2_aSi512_Tersoff_visualize_QHGK_properties.py
```

- Warning: While computing force constants using LAMMPS with a triclinic (non-orthogonal) cell, it follows a strict right-handed cell convention. More information about the cell conventioncan be found [here](https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_triclinic.html). The unit cell of the structure used in this example has been made based on the right-handed cell convention. Please be aware of this rule if lammps inputs were prepared from scratch. Alternatively, it is welcome to refer our [carbon nanotube example](https://github.com/nanotheorygroup/kaldo/tree/main/examples/carbon_nanotube_Tersoff_LAMMPS) where we imposed this convention and prepared lammps input files via a python script.
